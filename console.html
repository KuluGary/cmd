            <p><p style="align:center">-- GARRET has opened a memo--</p><br>
                I dunno why I am doing this<br>
                Doesn't make much sense leaving a note for someone who doesn't even know what I'm talking about.<br>
                've done weirdest things in my live for worst reasons, tho.<br>
                Thing is, Uma had a hunch.<br>
                Maybe at this point in time you already know the outcome.<br>
                Anyway, pay attention kid.<br>
                Maybe you're not a kid anymore?<br>
                This is important.<br>
                The Doctor had done some experiments about the nature of reality some years ago.<br>
                He wanted to understand our origin, what reality is made of.<br>
                But he saw... other things.<br>
                Strange readings on his machines.<br>
                I dunno what he was thinking at the time. That's more Uma's thing.<br>
                I just made the toys.<br>
                So, the focus of the investigation changed.<br>
                His reports showed some anomalies, things that shouldn't be there.<br>
                Every line, every spiderweb came from a sole origin.<br>
                Soon after I discovered he had... another "assistant".<br>
                I took his secretiveness badly.<br>
                The Doctor refused to share what was happening behind the scenes, so I packed my things.<br>
                Uma stayed.<br>
                Only until the Doctor himself threw away the research and disappeared to god knows where.<br>
                Well, I do know.<br>
                But I digress.<br>
                The Doctor spent the good majority of a decade creating a window to the abyss.<br>
                And the abyss stared back.<br>
                He ran away.<br>
                From that research we, Uma and I, could only salvage bits and pieces.<br>
                The machines were auctioned, or thrown away.<br>
                There's... this line of code. Something the Doctor left behind.<br>
                I can't understand it, not clearly.<br>
                That was his thing.<br>
                I can't understand it, but... It's everywhere.<br>
                Like an echo.<br>
                Now I'm going to search for those echoes.<br>
                It's like trying to solve a word search.<br>
                But with several billion words.<br>
                Anyway...<br>
                Sorry I've not been at home much lately.<br>
                And well.<br>
                I'm not sure I am going to be able to be much from now on.<br>
                I've got work to finish, you know.<br>
                ...<br>
                Sorry, kid.<br>

                    [00:23:54] UMA: I wasn't expecting you to answer.<br>
                    [00:24:29] Gar: What is it?<br>
                    [00:25:20] Uma: Garret, the things are stranger everyday.<br>
                    [00:25:42] UMA: All of our readings are being proven wrong.<br>
                    [00:25:59] UMA: The world doesn't even follow its own rules.<br>
                    [00:26:22] GAR: Seems that way.<br>
                    [00:26:43] UMA: We need to do something about it.<br>
                    [00:27:52] GAR: I don't.<br>
                    [00:28:17] GAR: You and the Doc spent years convincing me that the world is fucked up.<br>
                    [00:28:28] GAR: That we shouldn't even be alive.<br>
                    [00:28:32] GAR: I'll take every second as if made from gold.<br>
                    [00:28:49] GAR: I'll keep on trucking like I've been doing. Living my life.<br>
                    [00:29:28] UMA: Not a very fulfilling one.<br>
                    [00:30:14] GAR: Who the hell are you to judge me?<br>
                    [00:30:21] GAR: I've been living under the shadow of a doomed future long enough.<br>
                    [00:30:39] GAR: As things are I'll keep doing as I'm doing.<br>
                    [00:31:32] UMA: And spending the rest of your live managing a sex shop?<br>
                    [00:31:53] GAR: Why not?<br>
                    [00:32:20] UMA: That's not what you wanted to do with your life.<br>
                    [00:32:58] GAR: If I've learned something from those times is that it's not worth to make plans for the future.<br>
                    [00:33:41] UMA: You know I'm sorry, Gar. You were too young to face that truth.<br>
                    [00:33:56] UMA: But you saw the numbers. You saw the anomalies. Everything was there.<br>
                    [00:34:21] UMA: But now there's noone but us. Someone has to get to the bottom of this.<br>
                    [00:36:11] GAR: ... What do you suggest?<br>
                    [00:36:51] UMA: Let's keep in touch.<br>
                    [00:37:34] UMA: I've been buying some of the Doctor's old machines that went to auction.<br>
                    [00:38:29] UMA: Come se me. You're the only other person who knows about the research.<br>
                    [00:42:45] GAR: Fine. Send me a time and day.<br>
                    [00:43:32] GAR: We'll talk then.<br>
                    [00:44:12] UMA: See you soon, Gar.<br>

                Hey, lil bro. Sorry I had to run this morning. Had to take care of a few things, you know how it is. Anyway, I've got a bunch of
                work I have to do in the city. I'm gonna be working extra hours for a while, so I won't be home as much. Just giving you the heads-up.</p>

                <p>I'll left you with the usual around. Anything you need you know the drill.</p>
                <p>Seeya around, bucko.</p>

                    "Yeah, hey. This is Garret speaking. This is the number you gave me, right? Well, this is voicemail so you won't answer. You
                    managed  to convince me to do something really stupid. I can't even comprehend how you pulled it off, but I'm doing my part."
                </p>
                <p>
                    "I've been following some old leads, but couldn't fing anything. Not a thing. Gotta try some different things, so I'll be taking
                    my time. No reason to rush through this, setting things up takes a while. Not to mention I've gotta keep an eye on my lil bro. I refuse
                    to put him at any risk for the research."

                <p>"Hey, it's me. Here we go again, huh? I've been making notes, and it turns out one of the leads might actually be worth chasing. 
                    I'll see where it takes me."</p>
                    <p>

                        of reception. The kid's bright but I think this is the longest I've been away and I don't want him to get upset. Maybe make a visit with
                        your kid? He was happy the last time he got to play with her."

                    It's not exactly helpful, but it's something. The anomalies really don't want to be found. Heh."
